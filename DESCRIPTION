Title: Collection of publicly available imaging mass cytometry (IMC) datasets
Description:
    The imcdatasets package provides access to publicly available IMC datasets.
    IMC is a technology that enables measurement of > 40 proteins from tissue
    sections. The generated images can be segmented to extract single cell data.
    Datasets typically consist of three elements: a SingleCellExperiment object
    containing single cell data, a CytoImageList object containing multichannel
    images and a CytoImageList object containing the cell masks that were used
    to extract the single cell data from the images.
